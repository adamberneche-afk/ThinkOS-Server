# RCRT Dashboard

> **⚠️ Superseded**: The dashboard docker-compose.yml actually deploys is [`rcrt-dashboard-v2/`](../../rcrt-dashboard-v2/README.md) (see its Docker Deployment section below). This Rust/vanilla-JS dashboard still builds and runs standalone but isn't part of the deployed stack.

A visual dashboard for viewing RCRT breadcrumbs as interactive node cards on a canvas.

## Features

### 🎨 **Interactive Canvas**
- **Smart Canvas**: Dynamically sizes based on breadcrumb positions with buffer zones
- **Unlimited Panning**: Navigate freely in all directions around content
- **Smooth Zoom**: Mouse wheel zoom with cursor-focused scaling
- **Auto-centering**: Automatically centers view on breadcrumb content

### 🎛️ **Left Control Panel**
- **Real-time Search**: Filter breadcrumbs by title as you type
- **Tag Filtering**: Find breadcrumbs by specific tags
- **Breadcrumb List**: Scrollable list with click-to-select and double-click-to-edit
- **Panel Toggle**: Collapsible panel to maximize canvas space

### ✏️ **Full CRUD Operations**
- **Create**: Add new breadcrumbs with title, JSON context, and tags
- **Read**: View full breadcrumb details with formatted JSON
- **Update**: Edit existing breadcrumbs with version control
- **Delete**: Remove breadcrumbs with confirmation dialogs

### 🎯 **Advanced Features**
- **Visual Selection**: Click breadcrumbs in list to highlight on canvas
- **Smart Tag Input**: Add tags with Enter/comma, remove with backspace/click
- **Real-time Sync**: All changes instantly reflected in canvas and list
- **Modern UI**: Glass-morphism design with smooth animations

### 📡 **NATS JetStream Integration**
- **Real-time Events**: Live event stream from NATS JetStream
- **Event Monitoring**: See breadcrumb creation, updates, and system events
- **Stream Controls**: Pause/resume, clear log, auto-scroll toggle
- **Color-coded Events**: Green for create, blue for update, gray for heartbeat
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicator shows stream health

## API Endpoints

### Dashboard Interface
- `GET /` - Main dashboard web interface with left panel and canvas

### Breadcrumb Management  
- `GET /api/breadcrumbs` - List all breadcrumbs
- `POST /api/breadcrumbs` - Create new breadcrumb
- `GET /api/breadcrumbs/:id` - Get breadcrumb context details
- `PATCH /api/breadcrumbs/:id` - Update existing breadcrumb
- `DELETE /api/breadcrumbs/:id` - Delete breadcrumb

### Real-time Events
- `GET /api/events/stream` - Server-Sent Events stream (proxied from RCRT)

### System
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## Environment Variables

- `RCRT_URL` - Base URL of RCRT API server (default: `http://localhost:8080`)
- `OWNER_ID` - Owner UUID for RCRT API access
- `AGENT_ID` - Agent UUID for RCRT API access  
- `RUST_LOG` - Logging level (default: `info`)

## Running Locally

```bash
# Set environment variables
export RCRT_URL=http://localhost:8080
export OWNER_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
export AGENT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000cc

# Run the dashboard
cargo run -p rcrt-dashboard
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:8082`

## Docker Deployment

This crate is **not** what the root `docker-compose.yml`'s `dashboard` service deploys - that service builds `rcrt-dashboard-v2/frontend` instead (see [rcrt-dashboard-v2/README.md](../../rcrt-dashboard-v2/README.md)). This Rust dashboard has its own `Dockerfile` and is still a Cargo workspace member, but it isn't wired into the compose stack. To run it, build and run the binary directly (see Development above), or add your own compose service pointing at this crate's `Dockerfile` if you want it running alongside the rest of the stack.

## Authentication

The dashboard supports both JWT authentication and disabled auth modes:

- **JWT Mode**: Automatically requests a token from RCRT API on startup
- **Disabled Mode**: Uses direct API access when RCRT is in `AUTH_MODE=disabled`

The dashboard will gracefully handle authentication failures and continue operating in read-only mode.

## Usage Guide

### 🔍 **Filtering & Search**
1. **Title Search**: Type in the "Search Title" field to filter breadcrumbs in real-time
2. **Tag Filter**: Enter a tag name to show only breadcrumbs with that tag
3. **Clear Filters**: Use "Clear Filters" button to reset and show all breadcrumbs

### ➕ **Creating Breadcrumbs**
1. Fill out the "Create New" form in the left panel:
   - **Title**: Required breadcrumb title
   - **Context**: JSON object (e.g., `{"category": "example", "priority": "high"}`)
   - **Tags**: Add tags by typing and pressing Enter or comma
2. Click "Create" to add the breadcrumb
3. New breadcrumb will appear on the canvas and in the list

### ✏️ **Editing Breadcrumbs**  
1. **Double-click** any breadcrumb in the left panel list, OR
2. **Single-click** to select, then click the "Edit" button
3. Modify title, context JSON, or tags in the edit form
4. Click "Update" to save changes
5. Use "Cancel" to abandon changes

### 🗑️ **Deleting Breadcrumbs**

**Single Delete:**
1. Click any breadcrumb to view details in left panel
2. Click the "Delete" button (red button)  
3. Confirm deletion in the popup dialog

**Bulk Delete (Delete All Filtered):**
1. Apply any filters (search, tags, dates) to show specific breadcrumbs
2. Click the red "🗑️ Delete All Filtered (X)" button that appears
3. Confirm bulk deletion - this will delete ALL currently visible breadcrumbs
4. ⚠️ **Warning**: This cannot be undone! Use carefully with filters.

### 🎛️ **Canvas Controls**
- **Pan**: Click and drag anywhere on the canvas to move around
- **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out (zooms toward cursor)
- **Reset View**: Click "Reset View" to center and reset zoom
- **Panel Toggle**: Click "◀" button to collapse/expand the left panel

### 📡 **NATS JetStream Monitor**
- **Right Panel**: Real-time event stream from NATS JetStream
- **Event Types**: See breadcrumb.created, breadcrumb.updated, and ping events
- **Stream Controls**:
  - **Pause/Resume**: Toggle event processing
  - **Clear Log**: Remove all events from display
  - **Auto-scroll**: Automatically scroll to newest events
- **Visual Status**: Connection indicator shows stream health
- **Event Details**: Each event shows timestamp, type, and breadcrumb ID
- **Panel Toggle**: Click "▶" button to collapse/expand the right panel
