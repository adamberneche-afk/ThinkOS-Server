## Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Load

**Problem:** Extension fails to load in Chrome

**Solutions:**
- Check that `dist/` folder exists and contains `manifest.json`
- Run `npm run build` again
- Check console for build errors

### Cannot Connect to RCRT

**Problem:** Red connection indicator, "Cannot connect to RCRT server"

**Solutions:**
- Verify RCRT server is running: `curl http://localhost:8081/health`
- Check Settings tab for correct server URL
- Ensure no firewall blocking localhost:8081
- Check docker compose logs: `docker compose logs rcrt`

### Agents Not Processing Notes

**Problem:** Notes save but no tags/summary/insights appear

**Solutions:**
- Verify agents are loaded: `curl http://localhost:8081/breadcrumbs?schema_name=agent.def.v1`
- Should return 4 agents: note-tagger, note-summarizer, note-insights, note-eli5
- Check agent-runner logs: `docker compose logs agent-runner`
- Verify OpenRouter API key is configured

### Multi-Tab Tracking Not Working

**Problem:** Tabs not appearing in context

**Solutions:**
- Enable in Settings: "Multi-Tab Context Tracking"
- Check background service worker console:
  - Open `chrome://extensions/`
  - Find extension
  - Click "Service Worker (Inspect views)"
  - Look for "[TabContextManager] Initialized successfully"
